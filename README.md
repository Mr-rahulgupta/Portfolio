## 📂 Project Deep Dives

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
* **Problem:** High customer attrition was impacting monthly recurring revenue.
* **Methodology:** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify churn drivers, followed by a Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE for handling class imbalance.
* **Outcome:** Achieved an **89% Recall rate**, allowing the marketing team to proactively target high-risk segments.
* **View:** [Jupyter Notebook](./projects/churn-analysis.ipynb)

### 2. Market Basket Analysis (Unsupervised Learning)
* **Problem:** Inefficient retail product placement.
* **Methodology:** Applied the **Apriori Algorithm** to transactional data to identify frequent itemsets and association rules (Lift, Support, Confidence).
* **Outcome:** Identified 3 key product pairings previously overlooked, leading to a proposed 5% increase in cross-selling opportunities.

## 🧬 My Data Science Workflow



I follow a structured approach to ensure model reliability:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** Sourcing and validating data integrity.
2.  **EDA:** Identifying distributions, outliers, and correlations.
3.  **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and feature scaling.
4.  **Modeling:** Iterative training and hyperparameter tuning.
5.  **Deployment:** Translating model outputs into actionable dashboards or APIs.
